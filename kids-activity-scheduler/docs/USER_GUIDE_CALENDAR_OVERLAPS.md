# Calendar Overlap Display - User Guide

## What is Calendar Overlap Display?

When you have multiple children with activities at the same time, the calendar now shows them **side-by-side** instead of stacking them on top of each other. This makes it much easier to see all your family's activities at a glance!

## How It Works

### Before vs After

**Before (Stacked):**
- Activities at the same time would overlap, making it hard to see all of them
- You had to click through to see what was hidden

**After (Side-by-Side):**
- Activities automatically arrange themselves in columns
- Each activity gets its own space
- You can see everything at once

## Visual Examples

### Example 1: Two Overlapping Activities

```
Monday 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   Soccer    │   Piano     │
│   (Emma)    │   (Liam)    │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

When Emma has soccer and Liam has piano at the same time, they appear side-by-side.

### Example 2: Three Overlapping Activities

```
Tuesday 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM
┌────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ Dance  │ Karate │ Art    │
│ (Emma) │ (Liam) │ (Mia)  │
└────────┴────────┴────────┘
```

With three activities, each gets 1/3 of the space.

### Example 3: Partial Overlap

```
Wednesday 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM

3:00 PM  ┌──────────────────┐
         │     Swimming     │
         │      (Emma)      │
3:30 PM  ├─────────┬────────┤
         │Swimming │ Guitar │
         │ (Emma)  │ (Liam) │
4:00 PM  └─────────┴────────┘
```

When activities partially overlap, the layout adjusts automatically. Emma's swimming takes full width until 3:30 PM, then shares space with Liam's guitar lesson.

### Example 4: More Than 4 Activities

```
Thursday 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM
┌────┬────┬────┬────┐
│ A  │ B  │ C  │ D  │
└────┴────┴────┴────┘
     +2 more
```

When more than 4 activities overlap, the first 4 are shown and a "+N more" button appears. Click it to see the additional activities.

## Using the Calendar

### Week View

The Week View shows 7 days at once, with each day displaying activities side-by-side when they overlap.

**Features:**
- Navigate between weeks using the arrow buttons
- Click "Today" to jump to the current week
- Each day shows activities in their time slots
- Overlapping activities appear side-by-side

### Day View

The Day View focuses on a single day, giving more space for activities.

**Features:**
- Navigate between days using the arrow buttons
- Click "Today" to jump to today
- Same side-by-side layout as Week View
- More room for activity details

### Mobile View

On mobile devices, the calendar adapts to smaller screens:

**Horizontal Scrolling:**
- When activities overlap, you can scroll left and right within each day
- Time labels stay visible while you scroll
- Swipe to see all activities

**Touch-Friendly:**
- All buttons and activities are easy to tap
- Minimum 44x44 pixel touch targets
- Smooth scrolling experience

## Understanding the Layout

### Activity Colors

Each child has their own color, which is preserved in the overlap display:
- Emma's activities might be blue
- Liam's activities might be green
- Mia's activities might be purple

This makes it easy to quickly identify whose activity is whose.

### Activity Information

Each activity block shows:
- **Title** - The activity name (e.g., "Soccer Practice")
- **Child Name** - Whose activity it is
- **Time** - Start and end time
- **Location** - Where it takes place (if provided)
- **Duration** - How long it lasts (in minutes)

### Current Time Indicator

A red line shows the current time in today's column, making it easy to see what's happening now.

## The "+N More" Indicator

### What It Means

When more than 4 activities overlap at the same time, the calendar shows the first 4 and displays a "+N more" button at the bottom of the day.

### How to Use It

1. **Click the "+N more" button** to see a list of additional activities
2. **View the details** of each overflow activity
3. **Click "Close"** to hide the list

### Why 4 Activities?

We limit the display to 4 activities to keep the calendar readable. With more than 4, the columns become too narrow to show useful information.

## Tips for Best Experience

### On Desktop

- **Use Week View** to see your entire week at a glance
- **Hover over activities** to see full details in the tooltip
- **Click activities** to view or edit them

### On Mobile

- **Use Day View** for easier navigation on small screens
- **Scroll horizontally** within a day to see all overlapping activities
- **Tap activities** to view or edit them
- **Use landscape mode** for more space when viewing Week View

### Managing Many Activities

If you frequently have more than 4 activities at the same time:

1. **Check the "+N more" indicator** regularly
2. **Consider staggering activities** if possible
3. **Use Day View** to focus on one day at a time
4. **Color-code children** to quickly identify activities

**Solution:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I change the maximum number of columns?

**A:** Currently, the maximum is set to 4 columns for optimal readability. This may become configurable in a future update.

### Q: Why do some activities change width?

**A:** When activities partially overlap, the layout adjusts to give each activity appropriate space. An activity might be full-width when alone, then narrow when others overlap.

### Q: Can I disable the overlap display?

**A:** The overlap display is always enabled as it improves visibility. If you prefer a different view, try using the Day View for a more focused experience.

### Q: Do overlapping activities affect notifications?

**A:** No, the overlap display is purely visual. All activities still send notifications as configured.

### Q: Can I print the calendar with overlaps?

**A:** Yes, the calendar can be printed. The overlap layout will be preserved in the print view.

### Q: Does this work offline?

**A:** Yes! The overlap display works offline as part of the PWA functionality. Activities are cached and displayed correctly even without internet.
